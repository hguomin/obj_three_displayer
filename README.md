# Three.js obj/mtl displayer
### Reads obj/mtl via Three.js and creates a scene with mouse controls

### I also touched up the model and added some materials in Maya (triangulated and filled too)

```
(requires Node.js)
$ npm install
$ node . 
```
- For live reload:

- Run `gulp` and start the addon
- Will reload on changes to files in client/js
